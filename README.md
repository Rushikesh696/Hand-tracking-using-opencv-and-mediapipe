## 🧠 Role of OpenCV and MediaPipe

### 🧿 MediaPipe
- Provides a pretrained and optimized **hand tracking solution**
- Detects **21 landmarks** for each detected hand
- Supports **multi-hand tracking**
- Handles hand orientation, confidence scores, and landmark smoothing

### 🎥 OpenCV
- Handles **video capture** from webcam or video files
- Draws hand landmarks and connections on frames
- Displays processed frames in real-time
- Calculates **frames per second (FPS)** to monitor performance
